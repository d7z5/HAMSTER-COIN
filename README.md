# HAMSTER COIN (on Solana blockchain)
Functioning as symbolic representations of earned value

## Not a meme coin, no future value. Parents/teachers welcome!

Whenever my children do something positive, such as washing dishes, playing outside, or excelling in school, **they earn HAMSTER Coins**. We've established a one-to-one ratio, meaning one Hamster Coin is earned for each good deed. For instance, spending 2 hours outdoors earns them 2 coins. But you can use differently of course. These coins are then transferred to their digital wallet. Later, when they wish to play games or watch TV, they must 'spend' their coins. Every 15 minutes of screen time costs them one coin, so an hour of entertainment requires 4 coins. This system has proven highly effective for my kids.

HAMSTER Coin can serve also other purposes, such as in **school competitions** and various activities where goals must be achieved among students or entire classes. Just envision the possibilities.

Introducing kids to **the concept of responsibility and the rewards of hard work** is a valuable lesson. It teaches them that their efforts can **accumulate** and lead to positive outcomes. Through this approach, children learn the importance of investing effort to enhance their "wealth," which encompasses their well-being and achievements and to develop strategies to achieve their goals. 

I've even discussed this initiative with their **teachers**, who now offer Hamsters as rewards for good effort, behavior, and grades **in school**. This **collaboration between home and school** reinforces the message of effort leading to rewards, fostering a sense of responsibility and motivation in the children.

**Divorced parents** can also collaborate, ensuring that the positive efforts made in one household are recognized and carried over to the other. This means that the Hamster coins earned by the children can be used consistently **across both parents' homes**, reinforcing the sense of **continuity and fairness** in the reward system regardless of where the children are staying. Such collaboration fosters a unified approach to teaching responsibility and encourages consistency in behavior expectations and rewards across different environments.

### How does it work?


1. **EARNING** Parents send HAMSTER coin that is equal to activities completed. For example, one completed activity earns one hamster coin. Some harder tasks can be worth 2, 3 or more coins.
3. **SPENDING:** When children wish to watch TV, play games, or engage in similar activities, they must use these coins for access. When their coin supply is depleted, they must undertake additional tasks to earn more coins. The parents send them these, and they can use them imidiately for free activity (sending back coin again) or save for tomorrow.
4. **TRANSACTIONS:** Typically, a fixed quantity of coins suffices, as they are continually exchanged between parties. A parent has 100 coins. It can allocate 1 coin to 15 minutes of free activity. It means that a kid has to have 4 coins in order to play one hour. The coins are moved between their wallets.
