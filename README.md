# HAMSTER COIN
Functioning as symbolic representations of earned value

## Not a meme coin, no future value. Parents/teachers welcome!

Whenever my children do something positive, such as washing dishes, playing outside, or excelling in school, they earn Hamster Coins. We've established a one-to-one ratio, meaning one Hamster Coin is earned for each good deed. For instance, spending 2 hours outdoors earns them 2 coins. But you can use differently of course. These coins are then transferred to their digital wallet. Later, when they wish to play games or watch TV, they must 'spend' their coins. Every 15 minutes of screen time costs them one coin, so an hour of entertainment requires 4 coins. This system has proven highly effective for my kids.

### How does it work?


1. **EARNING** Parents allocate "HAMSTER COIN" equivalents based on activities completed. For example, one completed activity earns one hamster coin. 
3. **SPENDING:** When children wish to watch TV, play games, or engage in similar activities, they must use these coins for access. When their coin supply is depleted, they must undertake additional tasks to earn more.
4. **TRANSACTIONS:** Typically, a fixed quantity of coins suffices, as they are continually exchanged between parties. A parent has 100 coins. It can allocate 1 coin to 15 minutes of free activity. It means that a kid has to have 4 coins in order to play one hour.


# Setting Up Wallet and "HAMSTER COIN": A Quick Guide

#### 1. Install Solflare Wallet:
Download Solflare wallet on your mobile phone or use the browser extension.

#### 2. Create a New Wallet:
If you don't have a wallet, create one. Write down the recovery phrase by hand; it's your only backup. Store it securely!

#### 3. Fund Your Wallet:
Purchase some Solana (even 0.3 is enough) to fund your wallet. It is needed to pay transactions in the future. Each transaction is about 0.0005 SOL.

#### 4. Set Up Kids' Wallets:
Repeat the process on your kids' devices. Ensure they also back up their recovery phrases. The best -- you do it.

#### 5. Fund Their Wallets:
Send about 0.1 SOL to their wallets so that they can pay transactions in the future.

#### 6. Receive 1,000 Coins:
Send 0.003 sol to the address: `nCbcLtBX1hNYMBqJyFrTkiB5zss2RBWAtnvvVTFKE8q`, and I'll send you back 1000 coins. It is easy, since I will know where to send HAMSTER coins. If you donâ€™t want to use it, you can burn your coins and get 0.0025 sol.

#### 7. Add the contract address into all wallets you want to use the coin:
Inside the app add new token with the address: CmG4vcd3rfnX3NAMFbtCACG36BTfobgMrwLjGaCTC3Dk (do not send SOL there!)
